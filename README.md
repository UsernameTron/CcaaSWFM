# Operations Intelligence Architecture — Interactive Portfolio

Interactive technical portfolio demonstrating contact center operations intelligence systems: multi-platform API integration, real-time anomaly detection, and systemic-first quality classification.

## Live Site

Deployed via Netlify. The `index.html` serves as the unified entry point with global navigation between both architecture demonstrations.

## Architecture Highlights

**Unified Operations Intelligence** — Custom MCP integration layer connecting CCaaS + WFM + Helpdesk APIs into a normalized data model with cross-platform anomaly detection. Includes interactive anomaly simulator with real-time classification.

**Systemic-First Quality Intelligence** — Gate-based QA failure classification engine that checks system health, pattern width, process currency, routing accuracy, and cohort correlation before generating any individual coaching action. Includes interactive scenario simulator with animated gate processing.
